Real 1.5
---

Real is a c-based interface for connecting R to Prolog. 
See the documentation at doc/html/real.html for more information.
There is also a paper doc/padl2013-real.pdf and a user's guide
doc/guide.pdf, but they both refer to earlier versions of Real.

Real works on current versions of SWI and YAP.
As of version 1.1 there is support for using Real on SWI web-servers.

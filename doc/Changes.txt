Todo:
		--- check new NaNs in SWI
		--- deal with y <- '$NaN'.
		--- sort(colSums(mds_drivers), decreasing=true)  % true not recognised as boolean
		--- consider returning the numeric '$NaN' rather than the atomic '$NaN' from R to (swi?) Prolog
		--- define nan/1 & infinity/1 ?
		--- add  support for infinity- there is already something there but Swi does not deal well with it
	 	--- just change c(...) vectors to use the standard vectors (ala matrices)
      --- when encountering an integer in atoms Data, cast it to atom, rather than exception
      --- fix frames,  Mt <- mtcars.  (segs faults right now)
		--- test on Yap
		--- interactions <- sapply(1:ncol(genomic_data), function(i) sapply(1:ncol(genomic_data), function(j) {f<- try(fisher.test(genomic_data[,i], genomic_data[,j]), silent=TRUE); if(class(f)=="try-error") 0 else ifelse(f$estimate>1, -log10(f$p.val),log10(f$p.val))} ))

     2022/01/17    patches for src/real.c from Jan Wielemaker: The type warnings will cause issues on some platforms (read: crash).
                   - Lacking the return value check for PL_put_term() can also cause a crash if this runs out of stack.
     2022/01/17    Fixed, -.. -> --dump-runtime-variables 
     2020/09/05    explicit loading of library(apply)

     2020/5/29    recompiled for SWI-Prolog 8.2.0
     2017/11/22   disabled bindRIO() on my work linux this mangles names of packages
                  when they are loaded
     2017/11/22   added PROTECT around R_tryEval()

2:0  2016/9/5 IJAR publication

1:5  2016/1/23 (j_review)
  New   op( 700, fx, ~ )
  New   =<  ->  <=
  Fix   - Expr  was cut too soon in atom conversion term transformation.
  Fix   new fix of a$b[c] <-d (test atomic rather than compound/3)
  Fix   a$b[c] <- d    (add example)
  New   @~@  ->  %in%  (maybe add example)
  New   R negation, !, operator.
  New   \=  prolog -> != R
  New   support for expressions in array indices: hmrn_pass <- hmrn[ hmrn$'Contamination' == "PASS", *]

1:4  2015/5/24 (configurable)
   Many changes from Samer Abdallah. Particularly supporting threaded deployment for web services.

1:3  2015/5/3 (collaborative)
   Changed is_rvar/1,2 to r_is_var/1,2.
	Changed start_r/0 and end_r/0 to r_start/0 and r_end/0 respectively.
	Changed devoff/0 and devoff_all/0 to r_devoff/0 and r_devoff_all/0.
	Deleted real_debug/0 and real_nodebug/0.
	Added   a bit of documentation to intro section and r_citation/2.
	Added   r_new/1.
	Added   <<- as a shorthand for r_new(Rvar), Rvar <- Expr with error handling.

	This is probably going to be a quick release, the following is quite interesting 
	Added  [Rexpr] <- Fun ++ Opts and related r_call(Fun,[rvar(Rexpr)|Opts] ).
	
	Added  support for $R_LIB_REAL in r_library, which allows to replace public libs with local source files.
	Added  r_remove/1 to interface.
	Updated  arity/3 and compound/3. % not tested on Yap yet
	Fixed  devoff_all.

1:2:0   2015/1/2  (regardless)
	Pack real.pl now reads 1.2 rather than 1.2.0. Fixes, (3rd part) are reserved for developement.
	Further structure added to real.c.
	Changes to C-interface to modularly & backward-compatibly support SWI-7 endogenous lists.
	Changed current_prolog_flag(real,none) to real_started(false).
	Changed prefs:start_r_auto(false) to current_prolog_flag(real_start,false).
	Added NaN examples.
   Fixed NaN in beginning of matrices and matrix rows.
	Silent loading of <- library(Lib) and added ?- r_library(Lib)
	Added  support for NaN in matrices and vector shifting. ('$NaN' bi- and '' uni-directional (Prolog -> R) ).
	Support for   x <-  [row(1,2,3),r(4,5,6)].
   Fixed   x <- list().   on Swi 7.
	Cushioned Yap use by wrapping thread_self/1 to real_thread_self/1.

1:1:0       2014/02/15    (thankless_task)
	Added support for threaded execution.
	We need to look into environments to make deployment easier.

1:0:4       2014/12/25
	Fixed passing unamed R lists to Prolog pairs. Missing name is the number
	position. Added example for that.

0:1:2       2013 November 3   (the_stoic)
   Added support for a[x,y] and a().
	Corrected some branch variables, thanks to new Swi warnings.
	Jan, added some stuff on strings support. 

0:1:1       2013 January 17   (cross_compiled)
	swipl-win.exe doesnot use the std I/O streams. So <-print/1 doesnot display
	on console. Added message that only displays when Prolog was started with
	swipl-win.exe and only once. The windows dlls are now cross compiled. 
	There are now also shared (.so) libs for linux i386 and x86_64.
	Added Makefile.swi to the sources.

0:1:0       2012 December 26   [oliebollen]
   First release with updated syntax, documentation and Windows binaries.
	Reflects state of affairs for the PADL 2013 related publication.
   Great work by Vitor on passing c() via C and on utf support.

0:0:5       2012 September 12
   ?fixed?  * in array indicators (tut5) broken (why ?).
   Moved real_ex.pl to examples/for_real.pl
   Fixed '  x <- list(.),  x$a <- 3.  '. Added to examples (composite_list).
   In readme.txt autoconfig -> autoconf.
   Support $ as term. 
   Expand the cases understood as printable to include ^ and $.
   Added r_wait/0.

0:0:4       2012 May 24
   Fixed translation of P <- (v1-v2)^2, (report: Michiel Hildebrand)
   Added a (v1-v2)^2 example to real_ex.pl .

0:0:3       2012 Feb ??
   Complete re-writing of the C-code for SWI interface. (80% done by Jan Wielimeker.)
   Added examples/pagerank.pl (Vitor Santos Costa).

0:0:2       2011 Dec ??
0:0:1       2011 Dec ??

   First two releases only shown to Vitor and Jan.

24.05.08 - in real.c's matrix_sexp seems suspicious that we do not increment "nprotect" after the switch PROTECT's
         - passing a ~ 26000 long vector from R to PL within a findall/3 led to "killed" crash

On MacOs the macports binary seems not to be working properly (eg median()). (Michiel Hildebrand, May 2012). The issue does not persist for MacOS binaries (i assume) from R.

On windows XP the setting of PATH does not seem to be work from within Prolog.
User needs to set the PATH to include the R.dll directory  (and possibly R_HOME/modules/<exec-arch>/)
through the graphical interface ( right-click on computer and then add to the User or System
environment variable PATH).
